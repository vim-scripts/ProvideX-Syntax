ProvideX is a Business Basic dialect used within the popular Mas90/200 accounting product lines, as well as many other business software products.

I do not advocate the use of providex.  I only hope to aide those who have found themselves in the position of working with it as I have :-)

Pointers were taken from many syntax files, mainly the basic.vim syntax file from Allan Kelly. <allan@fruitloaf.co.uk>

Update: I no longer work with ProvideX!  Congratulations are welcome :-)
